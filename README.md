# ViperDisplayGen
Aircraft display generator for training documentation.

This project is a Python code library which will generate code which can be processed by groff/pic to generate aircraft displays for formal training documentation.  The code was originally designed for US F-16 aircraft multi-function displays, but can be adapted to any aircraft with modifications/additions to the source files.

Thanks to Eric S. Raymond for his work with pic and particularly his excellent documentation, without which this project would not have been possible.

The software is released under the GPLv2 license, a copy of which is available in the source repository.
